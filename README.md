Lists
=====

`HappyDemon\Lists` is a [Laravel](http://laravel.com) 5 package that makes it easy to set up [dataTables](https://datatables.net) for you front-end
code, as wel as handle the requests that it requires to retrieve data.

I've taken a similar approach to this problem as Laravel's own form `Request`'s.


## Installation

First run composer require:

    composer require happydemon/lists
    
Next open up `app/config/app.php` and add the serviceProvider:

    'HappyDemon\Lists\ServiceProvider',
    
Once that's done open up `app/Http/Kernel.php`, we'll need to add a trait to the class and a new property:

```php
    use \HappyDemon\Lists\Http\KernelTrait;
    
    /**
    * DataTable definitions (the key is used as a slug for routing)
    * 
    * @var array
    */
    protected $tables = [];
``

Lastly you'll create a new folder called `Tables` in `app/Http` and you're all set to go.

However if you'd like to make use of the config that comes bundled, you could run the following command in your terminal:

    php artisan php artisan vendor:publish --provider="HappyDemon\Lists\ServiceProvider"

## Documentation

I've written down the documentation in this repo's [wiki](https://github.com/happyDemon/Lists/wiki)

It won't be complete until I reach a stable milestone.
